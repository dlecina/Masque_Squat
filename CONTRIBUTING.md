## Localization

Due to the scope of _World of Warcraft_ and its gaming community, one of the most important ways one can contribute to an add-on is through translations. The recommended way of contributing in this way is by using the [localization system] on WoW Ace, which provides a web interface to simplify the process.

However, this is the first addon I have "developed" (let's be honest, it's just a skin based on existing code) and I have yet to support WoW Ace. So, for now, please contribute directly via pull request.

## Bug Reports

When reporting issues with this add-on, please use the [issue tracker] on GitHub. This helps keep them in one location, making it easier to keep track of them. Always make sure there isn't an existing issue on the problem you're having.

### Submitting a Bug Report

Explain the problem and include as much information as possible. When creating the report, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use a short but descriptive title.
- Specify the version of the add-on and any dependencies you have installed.
- Describe, in detail, the steps necessary to reproduce the problem.
- Include any additional information or screenshots that may be relevant to addressing the issue.
- When posting error messages, please enclose them in code blocks.
